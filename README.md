# -Cosmetic-Ingredient-Analysis-and-Recommendation-System-Using-t-SNE-for-Dimensionality-Reduction-
A **Cosmetic Ingredient Analysis and Recommendation System** using **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction to cluster products and provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and skin type. The system helps users make informed choices by analyzing ingredient profiles effectively.


A Cosmetic Ingredient Analysis and Recommendation System that leverages t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction to cluster cosmetic products and provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and skin type.

📋 Project Overview
With an increasing variety of cosmetic products available, it can be challenging for consumers to understand which products best suit their skin type and concerns. This project analyzes cosmetic product ingredient data, reduces dimensionality using t-SNE, and clusters similar products to help users make informed decisions. It provides personalized recommendations based on user input, making the skincare selection process easier and more effective.

🎯 Key Features
Ingredient Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes cosmetic product ingredient data.
Dimensionality Reduction: Utilizes t-SNE to reduce high-dimensional data for easier visualization and clustering.
Clustering and Visualization: Groups similar products based on ingredient profiles and displays clusters using visualizations.
Personalized Recommendations: Provides product recommendations tailored to user preferences such as skin type and concerns.
🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
Python for data processing and analysis
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning and dimensionality reduction
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
